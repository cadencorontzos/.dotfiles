# Test

This in my default shell configuration

## Installation

Prerequisites
* git

Go to your home directory
```
	cd $HOME
```	
and run the install script

```
	cd .dotfiles
	sh install.sh
```

### Stow 

There may be issues with the symlinks if you already have some of the dotfiles with the same names in your home directory. If this happens, back up the files it complains about and try again.
